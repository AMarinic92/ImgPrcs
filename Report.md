# Image Recognition: Andrea Abellera and Andrew Marinic
 ## Introduction
<p>	The goal of our project is to create an algorithm for  image recognising. We will be using a series of images containing balls and other containing round objects that are not balls. The algorithm  will use the uncanny edge detection to reduce our test image to its edges. The number of trials can be modified </p>
